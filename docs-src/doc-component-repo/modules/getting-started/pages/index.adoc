If you want to use the Frontend Generator from CLI, check xref:cli-specific-instructions.adoc[here] for CLI-specific instructions. Otherwise, proceed to xref:learning-path.adoc[this section].

CAUTION: Majority of features provided by CLI are supported by the Studio, but there are few exceptions. Check xref:generator:commands-reference.adoc[Frontend Generator Reference] to see which features are supported. Also you will want to use CLI if you prefer to have your frontend client as a separate project rather than as part of your Jmix project (e.g. you may have different teams working on frontend and backend).
