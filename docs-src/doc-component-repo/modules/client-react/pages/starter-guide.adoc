= Getting Started with React Client
:experimental:

In this guide we will use Jmix Studio to create a starter React client and add screens to browse and edit an entity.

Select *Jmix* view in *Project* tool window. Right-click on project name and select *Generate frontend*. Choose *React* module preset.

Starter React client will be created in the `frontend` directory.

== Exploring the Generated Project

Here is the structure of a newly generated project:

....
app-name/
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  node_modules/
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    index.css
    index.tsx          <- App entry point. Do not move/rename this file
    routing.ts         <- Routing configuration
    app/
      App.css
      App.tsx          <- App shell. Switches between Login form and internal application
    cuba/              <- Jmix Model. See [Backend model]
      entitites/       <- Project entities
      enums/           <- Project enums
....

== Running the Client

Navigate to the directory with the generated React client and run the following command to install the dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

Now you can run the client by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----

This will launch a dev server and allow you to access your app at `localhost:3000`.

This is what you will see once you open your project in a browser.

Enter existing user's login and password.

That's it! Congratulations, you have just created your first React client!

== Adding Components

So far our React client doesn't do much. Let's add the screens to browse and edit an entity.

=== Adding Components

In *Jmix* view of *Project* tool window expand *Sources* and right-click on an entity class. Select menu:New[Frontend Component]. Select menu:Entity{sp}management[Next, Finish].
