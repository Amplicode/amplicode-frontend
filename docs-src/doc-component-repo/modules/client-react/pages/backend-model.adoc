= Backend Model

`src/cuba` directory contains TypeScript representation of project's entities, fetch plans and facades to access REST services and queries. See more details in xref:typescript-sdk:index.adoc[TypeScript SDK] section. Here is the layout of the directory:

* `entities` - project entities and views;
* `enums` - project enums;
* `services.ts` - middleware services exposed to REST;
* `queries.ts` - REST queries.

Consider this example entity.

[source,typescript]
----
export class User {
  static NAME = "scr_User";
  id?: string;
  version?: number | null;
  username?: string | null;
  password?: string | null;
  firstName?: string | null;
  lastName?: string | null;
  email?: string | null;
  enabled?: boolean | null;
  phone?: string | null;
}
----

* You can easily access the entity name using static `NAME` property: `User.NAME`,
* The `User` class contains all properties of the domain model entity. Reference fields has corresponding types as well so that you can work with them in a type-safe manner.

[source,typescript]
----
user.enabled = true;   // ok
user.enabled = 'foo';  // compilation fails
